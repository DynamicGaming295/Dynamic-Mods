**Hey there!**

I'm Dynamic, the brains behind Dynamic Mods. You can catch me on YouTube, where I've got over 1.08K subscribers. Recently, I cooked up a mod menu for Gorilla Tag, and I'm super stoked about it!

Just a heads-up though, I gotta lay down the law: I'm not taking responsibility if you end up getting **banned** because of this mod menu.


**IMPORTANT!**
When downloading the Menu it may say "Virus Dectected" 
**The Menu is not a virus!** All mod menus like ii's Stupid Menu have the same issue!
All you have to do is turn off what is protecting your PC!
